###
1. Computer Running Windwos 10 +1902 and Up
2. WSL2 Install Look Below on How to Do so.
3. Linux Distrubtion from WSL2 Install. (Im Using Ubuntu 20.04)
4. Latest Python Installed
 -Python 3.8.3
  *Windows X64 Python 3.8.3 [Winx64-Python3.8.3]https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python-3.8.3.exe
  *Windows X86 Python 3.8.3 [Winx64-Python3.8.3]
 -Python 2.7

   *Windows X86 Python 2.7.18 [Winx86-Python2.7.18]https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.18/python-2.7.18.msi
5. Go Module for Windows

  *xCaddy Download [xCaddy Winx64]https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/releases/download/v0.1.4/xcaddy_v0.1.4_windows_amd64
7. I would Recommend But not needed Getting Midnight Commander because it will make looking for files 100x Easier in Linux distribution. Rather than waiting for terminal to find the file and search through the entire Server to find a file. I used Midnight Commander which runs through terminal. Meaning im basically running a UI File Browser but it doesnt require UI in the system. Menaing you wont have to go through the process of installing KDE or Gnome Desktop
   *Midnight Commander Install
    Ubuntu
    ```sudo apt-get install mc```
    RHEl,CentOS,Fedora
    ```yum install mc```
    To Run The File Browser in terminal Type ```mc```
    You Should get a windwos like so

##Things to Note

####
* Whenever you install anything on your System lets say through Windows. You have installed Python 2.7.18 and your running WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04. If i have already installed python on windows essentially its already installed on Ubuntu 20.04. I ran into a issue with Go where I installed Go 1.13.3 to my Windows 10 and i tried installing Go 1.14.4 and for some odd reason it wouldnt install. So make sure if you already have any of the programs installed on Windows or WSL2 make sure it meets the requrirements listed above. Otehrwise its gonna take you a while to figure out why you are getting errors thrown at you.
* Please follow my instructions to the Number. THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT. IF NOT DONE CORRECTLY YOU WILL HAVE A VERY HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING AND GO BACK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DID WRONG.
* With all that said This is for Intermediate or Well Seasoned Networking Noobs. Lets start.
